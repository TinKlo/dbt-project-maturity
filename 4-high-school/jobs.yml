# this is extremely not real code - jobs as code is an as of yet unreleased feature
# this is simply to illustrate that at this stage, you likely have a more complex deployment strategy:
  # 1.  a production run that represents a run of the full DAG every night, incremental models running as incrementals
  # 2.  a production run that represents a full refresh of the full DAG every week, to catch up for any late arriving data
  # 3.  a PR check run that runs the difference from feature branches and production when a PR is opened in the dbt
